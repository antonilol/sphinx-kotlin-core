# sphinx-kotlin-core

Kotlin Multiplatform library for all the core sphinx features.

## Getting Started

The following need to be installed to easily get started with compose-mpp:

- JDK 11 or later (**preferrable to have JDK 15**, any higher version might give you issues with gradle).
- IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition or Ultimate Edition 2020.3 or later (other editors could be used, but we assume you are using IntelliJ IDEA in this tutorial)
- Compose Multiplaform Preview Plugin (to preview UI changes without needing to app execute)

## PENDING Multiplatform Support

- Network Client (currently using okhttp, could replace it with ktor)
- Socket IO (could be replaced with a multiplatform alternative)
- Encrypted AppSettings
- Dependency Injection
- Cryptography 
    - RSA lib: currently using com.github.xiangyuecn.rsajava
    - Bouncy Castle
